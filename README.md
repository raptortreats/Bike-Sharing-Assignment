## General Information
- Data analytics, visualizations and model building for given dataset.
- we built an linear regression model to predict demand of bike sharing.
- The dataset used here day.csv


## Conclusions
With a thorough analysis of data and building the model we can observe that the Linear Regression model has 
predicted the demand of bike sharing with a R2 score of 80%.
